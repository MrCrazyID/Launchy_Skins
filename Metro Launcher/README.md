## Known issues
At a high theme resolution, the alternatives dropdown line item height can’t be set to a higher value. According to [this](http://sourceforge.net/p/launchy/discussion/766268/thread/02f9b236/) post, this can’t be changed.
For this reason, the font size, can’t be set correctly to a higher value.
