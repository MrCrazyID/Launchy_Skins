## What is launchy
> Launchy is a free cross-platform utility designed to help you forget about your start menu, the icons on your desktop, and even your file manager.  
> Launchy indexes the programs in your start menu and can launch your documents, project files, folders, and bookmarks with just a few keystrokes!
